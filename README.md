## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I've learned to focus on semantic HTML5 and explore CSS styling ways to achieve desired results, as I haven't a pay account on Figma, had to use MS Paint to get as closest I could on given card layouts mesurements.

### Continued development

I'm focusing on learning more about the newest frameworks, and AI dev tools.
